My name is **Jessa√≠ Maya**, a simple web developer who loves coding and learn about technology.
In the last year I fall in love with Rust. As a _front-end_ developer is kind of hard try to understand a lot of concepts of a `compiled + strong typed language` but this was exactly what I liked the most.
