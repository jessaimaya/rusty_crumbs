This is the beginning of my journey to learn Rust. From time to time I'll be throwing some crumbs... rusty crumbs.

```bash
    cargo new --lib rusty-crumbs
```
There's a lot of paths to follow... here are some I'll walk for sure:
- Webassembly
- Web Development [_fullstack_]
- Async / Networking
- Crypto
- Computer Graphics
- System Programming

The main goal of this site is to create a future reference for my own, I'm not very good remembering things.
I'm thinking to take what I learn from different sources like: books, courses, tutorials, etc. and create my own examples in order to practice.
